* **Backend (Routes, Controllers, Models, Middlewares):** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Dotenv, CORS, JWT, Bcryptjs.
* **Frontend (React app with Components, Contexts, Hooks, Pages):** React, Vite, React Router DOM, Axios, FontAwesome.

**Code Style & Conventions**

* **JSX (React) & CSS Files:** Use `PascalCase` so the file name matches the component and its style file.

* **JS Files:** Use `camelCase` for hooks, services, utils, and backend files.

### Getting Started with Docker

The project is fully containerized with Docker, ensuring a consistent environment for both development and production.

**Prerequisites**

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

**1. Environment Variables**
Create a local environment file by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your secrets (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, Spotify credentials).

**2. Running in Development Mode**
Hot-reloading for both frontend and backend:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

* Available at `http://localhost:5173`.
* Changes in `frontend` or `backend` trigger an automatic reload.

**3. Simulating Production Mode**
Build the optimized production image and run it locally:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

* Available at `http://localhost:3000`.

**4. Stopping the Application**

```bash
docker compose down
```
