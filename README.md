**Code Style & Conventions**

- **JSX (React) and CSS Files:** Use `PascalCase`. This ensures the file name matches the component's name and its associated style file.
  - *e.g.:* `HomePage.jsx`, `Collection.jsx`, `HomePage.css`, `Collection.css`

- **JS Files:** Use `camelCase`. This applies to hooks, services, utils, and backend files.
  - *e.g.:* `usePlayer.js`, `collectionService.js`, `songController.js`
